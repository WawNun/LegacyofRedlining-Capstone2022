#### ABSTRACT 


De jure and De facto segregation have systematically affected the lives of people of color throughout the United States. Nearly 90 years ago, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) enacted discriminatory housing policies by refusing loan and rental applications to African American families that resided in neighborhoods designated a “risk” or “hazardous” to investment. Present-day redlined neighborhoods continue to experience higher rates of pollution and environmental hazards than their counterparts. Environmental hazards like lead have disproportionately affected neighborhoods and cities composed of minority populations, as our nation witnessed several years ago in Flint, Michigan. Lead levels in schools’ water has become an increasing concern across California as outdated infrastructure releases lead into drinking water. California public schools were mandated under AB 746 to test water lead levels in schools built prior to 2010. This paper examines whether higher levels of lead exist in schools that reside in historically redlined neighborhoods compared to non-redlined neighborhoods. Through geospatial and statistical analysis, HOLC maps were digitized and analyzed with school lead level data to examine the legacy of redlining throughout eight California cities. We found no statistically significant relationship between lead levels and any of the historic HOLC grades in our regression estimates. Nevertheless, all four HOLC grades were significantly associated with testing frequency compared to schools in non-HOLC graded regions. Beyond econometric analysis our work also confirms prevalence of hotspots of schools for both outcomes in certain regions of the historically redlined cities of California.
